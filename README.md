# Fun Design Challenge with Shadcn, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and React Icons

This project was a fun little design challenge to get accustomed to using Shadcn components, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and React Icons. The goal was to recreate a clean and modern login form design inspired by Ajay Gorecha's work. "https://www.figma.com/community/file/872144934711314532"

## Project Overview

This project features a simple login form that includes:
- A cart icon centered vertically at 1/3 of the screen.
- Username and password input fields.
- A login button.
- A "Forgot Password?" link aligned to the right.
- A background with SVG's

## Tools and Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **Shadcn Components**: Used for building reusable UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Icons**: For including popular icons in the project.

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
